I have moved from Stockholm to Uppsala, a small town about 80 km north of Stockholm. I still work in the capital, in the same firm, but decided that the noice, the smell and the filth of a big city is not what I want to spend my spare time in.  Now I travel the 80 km everyday with train which has given me a lot of time for Mint. I get up 05:30 am and take a train for about 40 minutes. That is enough for solving at least one problem. Then I have 8 hours of work where my unconsiousness may figure out the next step before I travel home and have another 40 mintues of coding.  That'll give me roughly 6,5 hours of work every week on Mint, if I exclude weekends. That is probably more than I spent during the fall all together.
